I'm Sourav and I work on open source sustainability and operations management. Currently working full time at Open Source Collective a nonprofit based in CA, USA. I’m passionate about Open Source, Program Management, Data Science, and privacy-enhancing technologies. I’m also an advocate for open source and open science movements and actively contributing for the larger open source benefits. 

Previously I led open source programs, communities and managed mentorship programs like google summer of code and google season of docs. I have also mentored at google code-in for the TensorFlow organization and mentored thousands of enthusiasts to start their open source and private AI journey.

I led the Private AI mentorship program at OpenMined that launched the Private AI Series in collaboration with PyTorch, Facebook AI, the University of Oxford’s Centre for the Governance of AI at the Future of Humanity Institute, and the United Nations Global Working Group on Big Data.
